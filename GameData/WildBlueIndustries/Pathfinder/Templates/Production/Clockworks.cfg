  description = The Clockworks 3D Print Shop is the larger and more advanced cousin to the Blacksmith. In addition to having a 3D printer with five times the volume of the Blacksmith, you can switch between using MaterialKits and RocketParts to create components. The Clockworks also comes equipped with a recycling unit to recycle stored items back to MaterialKits/RocketParts with a conversion rate of 45%.
