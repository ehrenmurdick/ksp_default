  description = When an army of Gold Diggers aren't enough or the Drill-O-Matic is too unwieldy, the Claw Marks Strip Mining Module lets you rip those resources right out of the ground. The Claw Marks does use up a tremendous amount of electric charge and it generates heat, but a skilled Engineer can coax the drilling rig to operate at higher temperatures.
