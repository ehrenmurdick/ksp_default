  description = Somewhat of a "Rockomax wanna-be", this new corporation crawled out of the woodwork to start making competitive rocket products. While not as concerned with propulsion systems, focus has been shifted to making cost-competitive alternatives to fuel storage, structural, and aerodynamic components. While relatively unknown in the rocket industry, MRS hopes to secure a position in this growing market.
